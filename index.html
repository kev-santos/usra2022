        <u>Assignment 1 feedback:</u> *Note this is <b>not</b> comprehensive! Check the posted solutions as well. <small>(updated June 7)</small>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Write your full name as it appears on your Quercus account.</b></li>
            <li>Don't write "stacks of equations". When writing a calculation, try to write a justification for each line. </li>
            <li>If proving a fact about Riemann sums, begin by introducing a Riemann partition ("Let {x_i} be a Riemann partition...") so that x_i is defined. </li>
            <li>To claim something about an entire sum, you need to show that it is true for each of the terms in the sum. </li>
	    <li>If you take out a term like "1/n" from a sum, make sure you indicate that 1/n is "constant with respect to the index".</li>
	    <li>To justify that a set is a partition of an interval [a,b] you need two things: (1) each point is an element of [a,b] AND (2) identify the delta x value.</li>
	    <li>A picture is not enough for a proof. Use a combination of calculations and words to write a detailed argument.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
    
    <p>
        <u>How tutorials will run</u> <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Starting in Week 3 (week of May 23rd), tutorials will have an evaluation <b>every week</b>.</li>
        <li>Evaluations will be held at the start of tutorial.</li>
        <li>The evaluation will be based on the assignment released the previous week. If this is week N, it will be based on assignment N-2.</li>
        <li>This evaluation will be <b>either</b> a quiz OR you will hand in your solutions to the homework questions from the relevant assignment. (<b>Only</b> the "Homework" questions, not the "Exercises")</li>
        <li>You will find out which it will be (quiz or hand-in) at the start of tutorial.</li>
        <li>Before tutorial, you should have completed and written down your solutions to the homework questions.</li>
        <li>You may only submit evaluations in the tutorial you're officially registered in (the one you're enrolled in on ACORN).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Some advice for this course</u> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Make your own set of notes so you can easily refer to definitions and theorems.</li>
            <li>Do all the questions and exercises on the assignment, not just the ones you have to hand in.</li>
            <li>Practice the T/F questions in particular.</li>
            <li>Attend office hours and ask questions.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
